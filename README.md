# APMAE4990 - Introduction to Data Science in Industry

### Instructor: Dorian Goldman
### Term: Spring 2019
### Location: R 5:30pm-8:00pm 1024 Seeley W. Mudd Building

### Objectives: 
This course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students who wish to learn the fundamentals of data science and machine learning in the context of real world applications. An emphasis will be placed on problems encountered by companies such as Amazon, Booking.com, Netflix, Uber/Lyft, The New York Times and others. Despite a focus on applications, the course will be mathematically rigorous, but the goal is to motivate each tool by a concrete problem arising in industry. The course will follow an online iPython notebook where students can try out various algorithms in real time as we go through the course.


There will be no midterms or exams, but rather assignments which will be handed in periodically throughout the term. 

**Update:** While in prevoius years the students were free to select their own projects, for various reasons I have decided to have everyone work with the same dataset this year. Due to the growing size of the class, this will allow me to more efficiently answer questions and to focus on the relevant data science concepts.  The project will be announced during the first few lecture of the class.
