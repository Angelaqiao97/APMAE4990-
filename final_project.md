# Final Project Grading Outline

# Data Engineering and Machine Learning

The bulk of the grading is in the following sections.

## Data Gathering and Preparation (30%):

- **Data integrity checks:** Did you account for missing values and outliers? Is there information leakage? ie. a variable which is actually inferred by the outcome (eg. predicting a user likes a movie using the fact that they've liked that movie before).

- **Features:** Did you convert categorical features into one hot encoded dummy variables?

- **Standarization:** Did you standardize your variables properly?

## Model Selection, Comparison and Cross Validation (50%):


# Design and Strategy

## Problem Statement and Usefulness: (5%)

Is the problem clearly stated and motivated? Is this something useful or is it contrived?

## Originality (5%):

Is this a clever and new idea? Or a new take on an old problem?

## User Experience (5%):

Is the website relatively easy to use? Does it accept some kind of user input and then apply a model, and return
the user information?
