# General mastery: 

When you really understand something (e.g., you've gone through the cycle of learning-doing-teaching-doing), you can express seemingly complex concepts in simple ways. Or you develop insightful views on things at a broader level and can explain it to others. E.g.,:


### 1. Discuss your views on the relationship between machine learning and statistics.

### 2. Talk about how Deep Learning (or XYZ method) fits (or not?) within the field.

### 3. Isn't it all just curve fitting? Talk about that.


### 4. How are kernel methods different?


### 5. Why do we need/want the bias term?


### 6. Why do we call it GLM when it's clearly non-linear? (somewhat tricky question, to be asked somewhat humorously---but extremely revealing.)


### 7. How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms? What are Fourier transforms, for that matter?


# ML skills specific: 

### Pick an algorithm you like and walk me through the math and then the implementation of it, in pseudo-code.

### OK now let's pick another one, maybe more advanced.

### Discuss the meaning of the ROC curve, and write pseudo-code to generate the data for such a curve.

### Discuss how you go about feature engineering (look for both intuition and specific evaluation techniques).


# Distributed systems:

### 1. Discuss MapReduce (or your favorite parallelization abstraction). Why is MapReduce referred to as a "shared-nothing" architecture (clearly the nodes have to share something, no?) What are the advantages/disadvantages of "shared-nothing"?


### 2. Pick an algorithm. Write the pseudo-code for its parallel version.


### 3. What are the trade-offs between closed-form and iterative implementations of an algorithm, in the context of distributed systems?

# Other (hands-on experience, past accomplishments, etc.):

### 1. Do you have experience with R (or Weka, Scikit-learn, SAS, Spark, etc.)? Tell me what you've done with that. Write some example data pipelines in that environment.

### 2. Tell me about a time when you ... { worked on a project involving ML ; optimized an algorithm for performance/accuracy/etc. }

### 3. Estimate the amount of time in your past project spent on each segment of your data mining/machine learning work.
Etc.
